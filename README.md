## What is this?
Vim is quite complicated. Complicated enough to be tackled with deep learning? Maybe.
[Vimgolf](http://vimgolf.com) serves as a pretty great data set to use to train a model. 
It's got a range of difficulties in the problems, and they're well formatted and easy to scrape.

## Setup
### Python setup
Run ```pip install -r requirements.txt```. I highly recommend creating a virtualenv first.
