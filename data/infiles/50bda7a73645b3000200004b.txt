lamb had a little Mary,
Whose fleece was white as snow.
And everywhere that lamb went,
The Mary was sure to go.

It followed her to school one day,
Which was against the rule.
It made the children laugh and play,
To see a Mary at school.

And so the teacher turned it out,
But still it lingered near,
And waited patiently about,
Till lamb did appear.

"Why does the Mary love lamb so?"
The eager children cry.
"Why, lamb loves the Mary, you know."
The teacher did reply.
