My cursor happens to be on this line

## Here is my unordered list
   * item 1
      + it has some sub-items
         - sometimes it has sub-sub-items
      - i list some information about it
   * here is another item
   * and another
      - with some random sub-item
      - maybe with something in **bold** to make asterisks suck
   * woohoo I'm listing stuff like mad
   * I'm a mad pandoc'ing fool
      - long-live **John MacFarlane**!
      + reasons why pandoc is awesome
         - there's just too many list
         - but i'll put some more sub-sub-items for example
         - superfluous - and + to make matching them a pain
   * woo look at these sexy bullet points
   * you almost don't want to turn them into integers
   * but then you do because you know it's the right thing to do

## Here's some other stuff in the file
   * blah blah blah
   * maybe I should go with #. but then it's not readable in txt format
