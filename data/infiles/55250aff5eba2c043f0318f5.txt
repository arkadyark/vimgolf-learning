the little prince visits the geographer



the sixth planet was ten times larger than the last one. it was inhabited by an old gentleman who wrote voluminous books.


"oh, look! here is an explorer!" he exclaimed to himself when he saw the little prince coming.


the little prince sat down on the table and panted a little. he had already traveled so much and so far!


"where do you come from?" the old gentleman said to him.


"what is that big book?" said the little prince. "what are you doing?"
