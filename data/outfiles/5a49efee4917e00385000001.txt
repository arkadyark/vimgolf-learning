Rules

1.Anyone can create a new challenge
2.Creator of the challenge is also the moderator: can view/delete solutions
3.Players can submit as many attempts as they want per challenge
4.Entries are ranked by score (lowest wins), ties broken by time
5.VimGolf initializes your Vim with a custom .vimrc - no custom modifications
6.No plugins, predefined macros, etc, are allowed - level playing field
7.Refrain from copy/paste, reading in the solution (:read), or using external tools
8.Cheaters will be publicly ridiculed by fellow golfers :-)

Note: We're definitely not trying to discourage Vim users from customizing their .vimrc's, defining useful macros or loading external plugins. Having said that, to have a fair competition, we need to level the playing field, and to do that, we're sticking to the basics.

A Happy New Year 2018 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
