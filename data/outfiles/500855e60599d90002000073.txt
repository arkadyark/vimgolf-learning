My cursor happens to be on this line

## Here is my unordered list
   1. item 1
      + it has some sub-items
         - sometimes it has sub-sub-items
      - i list some information about it
   2. here is another item
   3. and another
      - with some random sub-item
      - maybe with something in **bold** to make asterisks suck
   4. woohoo I'm listing stuff like mad
   5. I'm a mad pandoc'ing fool
      - long-live **John MacFarlane**!
      + reasons why pandoc is awesome
         - there's just too many list
         - but i'll put some more sub-sub-items for example
         - superfluous - and + to make matching them a pain
   6. woo look at these sexy bullet points
   7. you almost don't want to turn them into integers
   8. but then you do because you know it's the right thing to do

## Here's some other stuff in the file
   * blah blah blah
   * maybe I should go with #. but then it's not readable in txt format
